# Iconify Tools demo

This example shows how to convert directory full of SVG files to Iconify JSON format.

As a source, this demo uses Material Design icons from [Templarian/MaterialDesign-SVG](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-SVG) repository that is also available as `@mdi/svg` NPM package.

Process:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`.
- Run build script: `npm run build`.
- `mdi.json` will appear.

See `convert-mdi.js` for source code.
